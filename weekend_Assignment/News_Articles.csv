What should have been a direct contest between the BJP and the Congress in the Ladakh Lok Sabha constituency is now a three-corner fight with an alliance of local groups fielding an Independent to challenge the national parties.
The seat, the largest in the country in terms of area (173.266 square kilometers), goes to polls on May 20 -- the first major electoral battle in the region after it was carved out of Jammu and Kashmir and granted Union Territory status in 2019. While the BJP has fielded Tashi Gyalson, chief executive councilor-cum-chairman of the Ladakh Autonomous Hill Development Council (Leh), from the seat after dropping sitting MP Jamyang Tsering Namgyal, the Congress has nominated Tsering Namgyal as its candidate. Springing a surprise, the Kargil Democratic Alliance (KDA) fielded Haji Haneefa Jan, the Kargil district president of the National Conference (NC), which like the Congress is a constituent of the INDIA bloc.
The Congress has won the seat for the highest number of times -- six -- and had fielded Tsering Namgyal, the leader of opposition in the LAHDC, according to an agreement with the NC, as they were members of the INDIA bloc and the Leh Apex Body (LAB).

It was the LAB and the KDA that were spearheading the agitation in support of various demands of the Ladhaki people, including statehood and sixth schedule of the Constitution, for the past four years. But it hit a block in March after the BJP-led Centre did not agree with the demands.
However, now with the KDA fielding Jan, the challenges for the Congress as well as the BJP has increased in this seat that has more than 1.84 lakh voters -- a majority (95,926) in Muslim-dominated Kargil district and 88,877 in Leh district. The resentment against the BJP over its government at the Centre not fulfilling the demands is palpable and the party, which is eyeing a third consecutive term from Ladakh, has rushed Union Minister Kiren Rijiju to handle the situation. He arrived in the Union Territory (UT) on Saturday.
The agitation had intensified on March 6 with Leh observing a complete shutdown followed by a 66-day hunger strike which was suspended three days ago in view of the Lok Sabha elections. Renowned educationist and social reformer Sonam Wangchuk, who was also part of it, ended his 21-day hunger strike on March 26.
Talking to reporters after arriving here on Saturday, Kiren Rijiju said, ""...all the big demands of the people can only be fulfilled by the central government. I have come here to convey the message that any pending issue will be resolved by the (Narendra) Modi government alone."" Seeking cooperation and support of the people of Ladakh, Kiren Rijiju said it is imperative for the BJP to win the seat because ""if we lose the elections, we will be sad after doing so much for the region over the years, including fulfilling the dream of UT status"". He said it is the right of the people to raise their issues and ""it is our responsibility to safeguard the future of Ladakh which is a very sensitive and fragile region having distinct culture, traditional practices, customs and language..."".
Thupstan Chhewang won the seat for the BJP for the first time in 2014. However, he resigned from the party's basic membership in 2018 and is currently heading the LAB.
The BJP managed to retain the seat in 2019 with Jamyang Tsering Namgyal, who was denied the ticket by the party this time and who openly revolted against the decision. However, he joined the campaigning for Gyalson after being persuaded by the BJP leadership.
Trouble for the Congress candidate started when the KDA unanimously decided to field Jan as an Independent and also persuaded two others, who were contesting as Independents, to withdraw their candidature in his support.
The entire NC unit of Kargil resigned from the party on May 6 to revolt against the its leadership for ""putting pressure"" on them to support INDIA bloc candidate Tsering Namgyal instead of Jan. The NC has won the seat twice in the past, while independents have won it thrice.
After attaining UT status, Ladakh witnessed elections to both Leh and Kargil chapters of the LAHDC in October 2020 and 2023, respectively.
While the BJP retained power in the Leh hill council elections by winning 15 seats -- five short of its 2015 election tally, the Congress increased its tally from six to nine seats while two seats went to Independents.
In the Kargil hill council elections, the NC-Congress combine won 22 seats against two by the BJP and two by Independents. The NC on its own got 12 seats and the Congress 10.
Amid intensified Lok Sabha poll campaigning, which also saw several BJP leaders, including national general secretary Tarun Chugh, reaching out to the voters, Gyalson had said his primary focus will be resumption of dialogue between the Centre and the Ladakh leadership for resolution of ""pending issues"".
""My primary focus will be resumption of stalled dialogue (between the Ladakh leadership and central government). I don't believe that the dialogue is derailed but because of the Model Code of Conduct, no headway has taken place. Once the new government is in place, I am sure about the resumption of the dialogue,"" he had said.
Congress candidate Tsering Namgyal said his party has taken a historic decision to include granting sixth schedule to Ladakh in its manifesto.

""We support the four-point demand of the LAB and the KDA and we will forcefully raise the demands within and outside Parliament to fulfill the aspirations of the people,"" he said.

The Prime Minister's roadshow in Patna saw a massive crowd turning up to greet him. Standing atop a vehicle, modelled as a chariot, PM Modi was seen waving at a sea of people gathered on both sides of the road.
The 2.5-km long roadshow that began at 7.15 pm from Bhattacharya Road-Pirmuhani crossing ended at Udyog Bhavan near Gandhi Maidan.
PM Modi was accompanied by Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, Deputy Chief Minister Samrat Chaudhary, and BJP candidate from Patna Sahib Lok Sabha seat Ravi Shankar Prasad.

The 40 seats in Bihar are undergoing polls in all seven phases. In 2019, BJP-led NDA swept the state by winning 39 out of 40 seats, while Congress won just one seat. Lalu Yadav's RJD, a formidable force in the state, failed to open its account.

That little reality, the mirror (pun intended, because I do look like her), that situation is necessary, for sure. If I can be extra honest and say, the only pressure of having mom as mom is she is the epitome of strength.

Holding a roadshow with NDA ally and Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar in Patna, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has exuded confidence that the ruling coalition will do even better in the state than in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections and could even win the only constituency it had lost last time.
Speaking exclusively to NDTV during the roadshow on Sunday, the Prime Minister predicted a clean sweep for the alliance in Bihar and said in Hindi, ""I have spoken to our allies in Bihar. We had lost one seat (in 2019) and we may not lose even one this time.""
Stating that he has strong connections with the state and its people, PM Modi said, ""I have come here very often for organisational work and have visited different parts of the state. I have very old connections here.""

The Prime Minister said he has been to almost every state and there is a strong resolve all over the country to ensure the BJP and the NDA achieve their target of winning over 400 seats.
""Bihar has infused this resolve with new colours. It has given it new strength. The atmosphere across the country is mirrored in Bihar too,"" he said.
Bihar will be crucial for both the NDA and the INDIA alliance because, at 40, it sends the fourth-highest number of MPs to the Lok Sabha.  The opposition alliance was jolted earlier this year after Bihar Chief Minister and Janata Dal United chief Nitish Kumar switched sides yet again and went back to the NDA.
In the 2019 elections, the BJP and the Janata Dal United had contested 17 seats each while the undivided Lok Janshakti Party had fought six.

In a harrowing incident, a woman from Punjab has recounted how she was chased by four men in an SUV on National Highway 1. Harmeen Soch, a teacher by profession, was driving between Dhilwan and Subhanpur on the Punjab highway when the incident occurred. In a tweet on X, Ms Soch described the ordeal as a ''cat and mouse game'', and wrote how four men in a Scorpio chased her for 7 kilometres on on National Highway 1. In between the chase, she stopped at a petrol pump to let the men get ahead of her. However, the men allegedly halted somewhere on the road too, because she saw them catch up with her again.
Sharing a video of the car in front of her vehicle, she wrote, ''Cat and mouse game for 7km. Couldn't get these 4 men in Scorpio off of my back. Either they were tailgating or slowing right ahead inhibiting my drive. In between I made a stop at the petrol pump to let them move on. They must have halted somewhere on the road too as I saw them catch up with me again.''
Ms Soch then shared how she managed to outwit them and escape. ''Finally, I slowed down because speeding up on the highway was nerve-wracking. With speed now less than 50 kmph on NH1 which limits speed to 100 kmph (as in the video), I am thinking about whether to call the police or keep moving. Thought I'd try speeding up one more time as my slip road was coming up ahead. They sped up again to slow me down and I turned left at the last moment without indicator which resulted in them going on the elevated road and I on the slip road,'' she wrote further.

As the eastern Ladakh military standoff entered its fifth year, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar said India hopes for a resolution of the remaining issues with China and asserted that a return to normal bilateral ties hinges on peace and tranquility at the border.
In an exclusive interview to PTI, S Jaishankar said the remaining issues mainly pertained to ""patrolling rights and patrolling abilities"".
Specifically asked when a resolution to the dragging row can be expected in the backdrop of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's remarks to Newsweek magazine last month, S Jaishankar said that he only provided a ""big-picture"" viewpoint on the matter.

""We would hope that there is a resolution of the remaining issues out there. These issues mainly pertain to patrolling rights and patrolling abilities there,"" he said.
""I would not link it to the prime minister's interview per se. I think the prime minister was giving a big-picture viewpoint and his big-picture viewpoint was a very reasonable viewpoint which is -- after all as neighbours, every country wants good relations with its neighbours,"" he said.
""But today, our relations with China are not normal because the peace and tranquility in the border areas has been disturbed. So he (PM) was expressing the hope that the Chinese side should realise that the present situation is not in its own interest,"" S Jaishankar said.
PM Modi had said that the border situation needs to be addressed urgently and that stable and peaceful ties between India and China are important for not just the two countries but for the entire region and world.
S Jaishankar said diplomacy is a work of patience and India continues to discuss the issues with the Chinese side.
""I would say that we need to resolve those issues if the relationship is to come back to normal,"" he said during the interview on Thursday.
The Indian and Chinese militaries have been locked in the standoff since May 2020 and a full resolution of the border row has not yet been achieved though the two sides have disengaged from a number of friction points.
India has been consistently maintaining that peace and tranquillity along the LAC were key for the normalisation of overall ties.
Asked why bilateral trade volume with China is going up when New Delhi has been insisting that the ties cannot be normal when the border situation is abnormal, S Jaishankar suggested that such a scenario has arisen as adequate attention to the manufacturing sector was not given before 2014.
""I think it is common sense that if there is no peace and tranquility in the border, how can you have a normal relationship,"" he said.
""After all if somebody is at your front door in an unfriendly manner, you are not going to go out there and act as though everything is normal. That to me is a straightforward proposition,"" S Jaishankar added.
The ties between the two countries nosedived significantly following the fierce clash in the Galwan Valley in June 2020 that marked the most serious military conflict between the two sides in decades.
In the diplomatic and military talks with China, the Indian negotiators have been insisting on restoring the status quo ante of April 2020 along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh.
Defence Minister Rajnath Singh told PTI over a week back that the talks between the two sides are going on well and hoped for a resolution of the lingering row.
Following the Galwan Valley clashes, India has been majorly focusing on boosting its overall military capability along the frontier with China.

Srikanth largely opened to positive reviews. In his review for NDTV, film critic Saibal Chatterjee wrote, ""Srikanth tells the remarkable story of a young man endowed with exceptional vision and tenacity but does not shy away from pointing to the delicate junctures in Srikanth Bolla's life when he comes precariously close to letting his self-confidence turn into a degree of arrogance and success into streaks of insouciance.""

(courtesy: glamouralert)
Trinetra Haldar Gummaraju, who rose to fame after featuring in the second season of the web series Made In Heaven, recently has undergone facial feminisation surgery. Sharing an elaborate post, Trinetra informed her Instafam about the surgery and focused on ""transparency"" in her dealings. Without taking any name, Trinetra also talked about Rajkummar Rao, who was trolled for admitting the fact that he had chin fillers. Trinetra began her post with these words, ""8th April 2024 - FFS - facial feminisation surgery | spain wasn't just a vacation | chaotic sketches and diary entries on opioids. Facial Feminisation Surgery (FFS) is one of many interventions a trans person may undergo to feel more alignment between body and gender identity. Other gender affirming interventions may include gender affirming hormone therapy (GAHT/HRT), gender affirming genital surgery, etc.""
She continued, ""My transition is complete. I didn't think this final step would happen anytime soon, but it has. I did this by myself, for myself, and still can't believe it. Transition to me is deeply spiritual, and not the stuff of tabloids and speculative nonsense. I haven't talked about wanting FFS at all mostly out of fear of public scrutiny and judgement, but why shy away from something so important in this journey of accessing myself? Who cares what anybody thinks or believes, really? Truth be told, I've wanted this for a decade, and there were lots of reasons to wait. I ticked them all off one by one.""
Speaking of Rajkummar Rao, Trinetra wrote, ""An actor was recently trolled into sheepishly admitting he had chin filler, and a topper was trolled for (not doing anything about) her facial hair in the face of obvious academic merit. Screwed if you do, screwed if you don't, clearly. There is only this one body, this one life. If there is gender dysphoria, it has to be dealt with.""

Trinetra concluded her post with these words, ""I've lost count of how many people in the industry I've met who've had work done and will deny intervention. To each their own, but I do not wish to contribute to a culture of opacity that thrives on making masses of young people insecure. I have no interest in promoting bodily intervention, but I do believe in transparency, as has always been the case, especially as a doctor. My reasons were gender affirmation and confidence therefrom, as extensively deliberated on over years of therapy. Others may have their own. Doing this alone hasn't been easy, but my god, I'm convinced I'm f****** invincible.""

I feel it's certainly a touched-up picture because my skin is looking so flawless. Even I was amazed how it's so flawless without any makeup and after shooting the whole day.""
The actor, however, did mention that he got fillers a few years ago. ""But saying that... Because you know, I heard a lot of these comments when I started working. People started commenting on my looks and everything. 8-9 years back, I did a little touch up on my chin with fillers, which is like half-an hour job because I wanted to feel more confident, which I do. I certainly feel more confident. I feel I look much better, but has it changed me as a person, has it changed me as an artist?

Maldivian Foreign Minister Moosa Zameer has said that significant strides have been made in expediting India-assisted projects in the Maldives, as he underscored the government's commitment to prioritising the resumption and completion of these projects.
Mr Zameer, who visited India from May 8 to 10 on his very first bilateral official visit, said he and his Indian counterpart S Jaishankar engaged in bilateral discussions on May 9 to address pivotal matters aimed at expediting the projects initiated with India's financial assistance.
He said the discussions with S Jaishankar focused on the operational dynamics of the committees entrusted with executing these projects, psmnews.mv reported.

Speaking at a press conference held in the President's Office, Mr Zameer said India has given the Maldives the green signal to extend the repayment deadline for $ 150 million of a $ 200 million debt. The loan was secured by the previous government upon assuming office in 2019.
Mr Zameer said that $ 50 million of the $ 200 million owed to India was repaid in January. He emphasised that the Indian government has not made any demands in exchange for extending the repayment period of the remaining $ 150 million.
The minister said that a spectrum of initiatives across the Maldives have been kickstarted through loans and grants from India during the previous administration.
He said significant strides have been made in expediting India-assisted projects.
He emphasised the current government's commitment to prioritising the resumption and completion of these projects. He also underscored his dedication to this endeavour during his recent visit to India.
During the official discussions between the two nations, S Jaishankar reiterated the significance of India's ongoing projects in the Maldives.
Mr Zameer's visit to India came amid a downturn in the bilateral ties between the two countries since pro-China president Mohamed Muizzu assumed office six months back.
The relations between the two countries came under severe strain in view of Muizzu insisting on withdrawal of Indian military personnel operating three military platforms in the island nation.
Mr Zameer on Saturday said 76 Indian military personnel were replaced by civilian employees of the Hindustan Aeronautics Limited which manufactured the two helicopters gifted by India, thus also ending the suspense over the exact number of those repatriated at the insistence of Male.

The award for the best mother goes to Dia Mirza. The actress shares an amazing bond with her son Avyaan and step daughter Samaira. On the occasion of Mother's Day, Dia opened up about her equation Samaira. In a conversation with News18 Showsha, the actress said, “She hasn't called me maa. There are no expectations from her to call me ‘maa', ‘mumma' or ‘mother'. She has a mother who she calls ‘mumma' or ‘mom'. She calls me ‘Dia.'” Talking about Samaira's influence on her son, Dia added, “Thanks to her now Avyaan also calls me ‘Dia' once in a while. He says ‘Dia mom', it's too funny.” Dia got married to Vaibhav Rekhi in 2021. The couple welcomed their son Avyaan in the same year. Samaira is Vaibhav's daughter with his ex-wife Sunaina Rekhi.
During the same discussion, Dia Mirza also recalled the moment when Avyaan said “mumma” for the first time. “Oh my god, I will never forget that day. He said mumma much later. I think it was a good three months after he started to say words. It was a beautiful moment because all the flowers had started to bloom in the balcony and there were lots of butterflies visiting the flowers, and he was in my arms,” she said.
“I was showing him the butterflies and I was through the plants because there were three to four butterflies for him to get a closer look at it. He suddenly looked at me and said, ‘Mumma', I was like ‘Oh my god! What just happened.' Interestingly, my husband had his camera and he was recording me showing Avyaan the butterflies so we have the whole moment on cameras. It was magical,” Dia Mirza added.
Dia Mirza never fails to express her love and admiration for Samaira and Avyaan. On Samaira's 15th birthday, Dia shared pictures that were setting mother-daughter goals. Wishing the birthday girl, Dia wrote, “Happy 15th Birthday, baby girl. I carry your heart in my heart forever.”

Fresh tension erupted at Sandeskhali island in West Bengal today when BJP supporters allegedly attacked a Trinamool Congress worker during a protest.
Tatan Gayen, an aide of Trinamool MLA Sukumar Mahto, was attacked at a stone's throw from the local police station. Police reached the spot soon and riot control force was called in.
The BJP organised a protest on the island today, with party workers accusing the Trinamool Congress government of foisting false cases against them.

The nondescript island in North 24 Parganas made national headlines after residents accused local Trinamool leaders, led by strongman Sheikh Shahjahan, of land grab, extortion and sexual harassment. Shahjahan, now expelled by Trinamool, is in CBI's custody in connection with a mob attack on Enforcement Directorate officials.
In a shocking twist earlier last month, a viral video showed local BJP leader Gangadhar Koyal purportedly saying that no rapes or sexual harassment took place in Sandeshkhali and that women were convinced to file complaints on the instruction of BJP's Suvendu Adhikari, leader of Opposition in Bengal Assembly. The BJP and the leader in the video have claimed that the clip was doctored.
In another shock development, a woman has alleged that people linked with the BJP made her sign a blank paper and then wrote a false rape complaint in her name.
The developments have sparked a political slugfest, with the Trinamool accusing the BJP of cooking up stories to malign its image for political gains.
BJP workers today staged a protest outside the local police station and demanded action against local Trinamool leaders, who they alleged were spreading fake videos. Among the protesters was BJP's candidate from Basirhat, Sandeshkhali resident Rekha Patra.
Speaking to the media, a woman BJP supporter accused the local administration of filing false cases against BJP supporters. ""The Trinamool government is harassing us because the ground is slipping from under their feet.""
Responding to allegations that the BJP paid women to make sexual harassment allegations, she said, ""Did Mamata Banerjee come here even once and see anyone paying us? The mothers of Sandeshkhali have hit the streets for their honour.""
Another woman protester targeted the woman who has accused that BJP leaders filed a false rape complaint in her name. ""How much money have they got to claim that everything is a lie? They should be arrested, otherwise the people won't spare them.""

Preity shared that she feels like a superhuman when she is surrounded by her twins.""The happiness & pure joy I feel looking at them lights up my darkest days and I feel superhuman strength when I need to protect them. I'm sure I'm not the only mother who feels like this. Sadly, we only start appreciating our mothers when we step into that role. So here's a big shout out to all the mothers out there. The single ones, the working ones and the ones who devote all their time at home looking after their kids n families . It's really a job where there are no promotions, no time off & very little gratitude,"" she added.
""If you are lucky they will appreciate you when you are older when they become parents otherwise it's all about giving, loving & nurturing without any expectations . So give your moms a BIG HUG & say THANK YOU YOU LOVE THEM & APPRECIATE THEM cuz mom's are the closest thing to God #Happymothersday #loveuma #ting,"" she wrote.

To make her Mother's Day post more captivating, she uploaded a video featuring her adorable moments spent with her mother and her own kids. On November 11, 2021, Preity and her husband Gene Goodenough welcomed their twins, a baby boy named Jai and a baby girl named Gia, via surrogacy.

During the screening, Aamir shared something that had disturbed him while shooting for Sarfarosh. “I was really disturbed about one thing while shooting the film. I was in continuity with a couple of films that time. Toh main apne baal chote nahi kar paaya jitna mujhe chota karna tha. Toh woh baat mujhe itni disturb karti thi.

Ahead of the special screening, Aamir Khan expressed his desire for a sequel to Sarfarosh. He said, “I've been telling John (director) for many years to make Sarfarosh 2. Also, the film ended in such a way that we could make part two of this film. I've told John that if he writes a good story, then we can make a Sarfarosh 2. This time he told me he was trying.""
“I can commit one thing, that we'll definitely give it a really serious shot now, coming up with the right script and the right kind of film for it (part two),"" Aamir Khan added.

A woman in Taiwan has been accused of hiding her dead father's body in her home for years to claim his military pension. According to the South China Morning Post, the woman, whose identity has not been revealed, lived with her father for over five decades.
The authorities first got suspicious last November when health officials were denied entry to her home for dengue-prevention measures. As a result, she was fined NT$60,000 (approximately Rs 1.50 lakh)
Her constant refusal to allow government officials into her home raised concerns and prompted police involvement. When officers interrogated the woman regarding her father's whereabouts, she initially claimed he was at a nursing home

When police pressed her further, she changed her story, claiming her brother had taken him to the mainland from their city Kaohsiung. Cops investigated her claim and discovered that the brother had been dead for 50 years, and there was no record that the woman's father had left Taiwan.
The woman then lied again, saying that her father had died on the mainland and, but could not produce his death certificate.
The changing narratives led to the police searching her property and found a black plastic garbage bag containing the bones of an elderly person.
Upon investigation, police found that the man had been dead for a long time. A forensic expert explained that a body typically takes one to two years for a body to decompose into skeletal remains.
Notably, the woman's father had been a military veteran who served for more than 20 years and received a monthly pension according to his rank and service history. Taiwanese military veterans typically receive an average monthly pension of NT$49,379 (approximately Rs 1.27 lakh).
The investigation into the cause of the man's death is ongoing and authorities will determine whether the woman committed a serious crime beyond just hiding her father's body.
Under Taiwanese law, damaging, abandoning, insulting, or stealing a corpse can carry serious penalties, including imprisonment for up to five years. If such a crime involves a direct relative or close family member, the sentence may be increased by 1.5 times.

""But till that time, there are some films that I am working on which probably do not have those kind of action sequences or high-intensity drama sequences which I might not be able to do immediately,"" Talpade told PTI in an interview here.
Kartam Bhugtam, directed by Soham P Shah, is a psychological thriller movie set to be released in theatres on May 17.
The actor will also be seen in Kangana Ranaut's Emergency in which he plays the role of former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, comedy film Welcome to the Jungle, and will reprise the voice role of Allu Arjun's iconic character Pushpa Raj in the Hindi dubbed version of ""Pushpa 2: The Rule"".
""The kind of work that I'm doing right now and the line-up that I have in the next few months is very interesting. It's a nice mixed bag... I'm just keeping my fingers crossed and praying,"" he added.
According to the 48-year-old actor, films are supposed to be a big-screen experience.
""Films should be released in theatres and then whatever happens, you just leave it up to the audience. I think they are the best judges. Once they are spending money and coming into theatres, they want their value for money.
""Every film has its destiny. After you have done your job, it's time for the audience to watch it and give their verdict... As an actor, if you think you have given them something new, interesting, original, they will lap it up. If not, you move on to the next film, next story."" Talpade also said he wanted his film ""Kaun Pravin Tambe?"", a 2022 biopic on the Indian cricketer Pravin Tambe, to also release in theatres. Backed by Fox Star Studios along with Friday Filmworks and Bootroom Sports Production, the film got a direct-to-digital release on Disney Hotstar.
""I remember when the edit was locked, Neeraj Pandey (producer) gave me a call and said he loved both me and the film. He said the only regret he'll have is that we won't be able to release it in theatres because it's already commissioned for an OTT platform. We felt bad because it deserved a theatrical release. Nevertheless, it reached out to many people and that is what we eventually want,"" he said.
Talpade, who gained recognition with comedy roles in multi-starrer film franchises like ""Golmaal"" and ""Houseful"", said he is happy to be getting opportunities to showcase his different facets as an actor.
""You are in this profession to explore different roles, different characters. When you are typecast, you feel a little frustrated. But then again, there comes a time when people look at you differently.
""There are certain films which break that mould and give you an opportunity to showcase something else. That is the opportunity. If you don't really strike gold with that, I think it's your loss,"" he added.

35,Cannes 2024: FTII's Maisam Ali On His Debut Film In Retreat As India's First-Ever ACID Entry,https://www.ndtv.com/entertainment/cannes-2024-ftiis-maisam-ali-on-his-debut-film-in-retreat-as-indias-first-ever-acid-entry-5645478,2024-05-12,"A still from In Retreat
Maisam Ali, who learnt the ropes at the Film and Television Institute of India (FTII), is going where no Indian director has gone before - to ACID Cannes, a section that has been showcasing and promoting independent cinema since the early 1990s.
The delicately crafted, steadfastly minimalistic In Retreat, Ali's fiction feature debut, is the first-ever title from the world's largest film-producing nation in the ACID Cannes selection. It is one of nine films in the section's 2024 programme.
""I was hopeful that someone or other in France will take a liking to my film,"" says Ali, who was born in Iran, where his physician-father worked for the public health service before returning to Ladakh when his son was eight years old. ""My short films have screened in small French festivals in the past.""

Nothing, of course, could have been better for Ali than a world premiere in Cannes, where his FTII batchmate Payal Kapadia's All We Imagine as Light has secured a slot in the main Competition, the first Indian film to do so in three decades.
In tone and texture, In Retreat represents an inimitable vision and an original voice. It is far removed from all those Ladakh films that we usually see. Struck by the stark natural splendour and cultural uniqueness of the place, they stop well short of capturing the region's true essence. Not so Ali's film.
In Retreat probes the ventricles of Ladakh's heart instead. ""I wasn't looking for pretty images,"" says Ali. ""I wanted to show the interiority of the places that I have personal memories of.""
ACID (Association for the Diffusion of Independent Cinema) is a collective of filmmakers that helps directors, French and international, find distribution in Europe. The 77th Cannes Film Festival runs from May 14 to 25.
In Retreat is an understated 75-minute drama about a man who returns to a mountain town that he left many years ago. It examines the notions of belonging and not belonging from the standpoint of an individual whose wanderings and absences have created a chasm between him and what was once home.
Has the unnamed In Retreat protagonist been drawn from personal memory? ""Yes,"" says Ali. Years ago, he adds, he heard snatches of the story of a similar person who came back after being away for a long time. ""He visited my father's clinic and reminisced about his grandfather's store in the old market where my family had a photography shop back then. The memory of this man stayed with me.""
It took the shape of a larger fictional story. Says Ali: ""I imagined the man walking around, running into people and making small talk."" The returnee in his film, who is late for the funeral of his brother, is reluctant to step back into the house. ""He keeps postponing his return because he feels that no purpose will be served by his arrival,"" adds the filmmaker.
Ali refers to the logline of In Retreat to throw some light on the man's psyche. It reads: ""a person (who) has returned home but decides to stay outside in the shadows of the night"".
""My relationship with home is always ambiguous,"" says Ali. ""Home is where you find comfort but home is also a place where your boundaries begin building up.""
He refers to a line that the protagonist speaks: from outside, the house looks nirdosh (innocent) and bhaavuk (sentimental) but inside the house there is no beginning of hope nor an end (na ummeed ki shuruat na khaatma).
""That is my relationship with home,"" says Ali. Who is family and who is not? That is indeed the question that In Retreat explores in ways so subtle and intricate that it raises more questions about one's moorings, pretty much in the manner that the goings and comings, and the delays and the dilly-dallying, of the central character do.
After spending the first years of his life in Iran, Ali was in school in Ladakh. I have been out since after Class 10. I graduated in Delhi (from an engineering college) and then lived in Pune and Mumbai. ""I don't have a home,"" he says. ""I am here and there.""
Ali says that his love for cinema arose from the discourse around realism in filmmaking. ""Can we really capture time? Something is here right now and is gone the very next instant. For a man with a movie camera, that poses an insurmountable challenge,"" he says.
Cinema's struggle to grasp the ephemerality of beings, experiences and moments is what attracts Ali to the medium. To the mention of Bela Tarr, he adds several more names - Bresson, Ozu, Tarkovsky, Kiarostami. ""These filmmakers inspire us to push the medium as far as we can,"" he says.
Ali's cinematic credo is amply reflected in the way he utilises lead actor Harish Khanna. ""My idea of an actor,"" he says, ""is that he is a person, a being. I do not like people acting (and thereby expressing) in front of a camera. I am more interested in what you are hiding.""
Concealment, he implies, is of greater value than revelation in the craft of acting and in the making of a film. ""You should get a sense of things by watching somebody in front of the camera,"" he says. In my brief to the actor, once I was sure of the character's being, pauses and rhythms, I spoke mostly about matters philosophical and thematic.""
Talking about the austere but striking sound design of In Retreat, Ali is dismissive of the wall-to-wall musical accompaniment that marks films and shows on streaming platforms.
""Every line of dialogue is underscored by music. The process of creating sound (as a distinct element of a film) is as good as over,"" he laments. ""For me, the detailing and texture that sound adds to a work is of utmost importance.""
Ali's alma mater, FTII, has a big presence in Cannes this year. Besides his and Kapadia's films, a student from the institute, Chidananda S. Naik, is competing for a prize in La Cinef, a section for entries from film schools, and FTII alumnus Santosh Sivan, one of India's finest cinematographers, is the recipient of the 2024 Pierre Angenieux tribute.
How important, to Ali's mind, is film school education? ""As children, many are told that their handwriting is bad. But it is your handwriting that defines you. That is one of the things that I learnt at FTII. My artistic journey began there because of my teachers and because of the atmosphere at the institute,"" he says.

If you are conceptually strong, rules and techniques are not as important as the fundamentals, asserts Ali. ""What rules do we need for making films? We all have memories and dreams. We know that language all across the world we all dream,"" he adds.",2024-05-12 21:29:44.600480,NDTV

The stars of Heeramandi - Sonakshi Sinha, Manisha Koirala, Aditi Rao Hydari, Sharmin Segal, Richa Chadha and Sanjeeda Shaikh were the latest guests at Kapil Sharma's Netflix show The Great Indian Kapil Show. Featuring on the show as guests, the actresses' treated their viewers to some behind-the-scenes anecdotes and also shared their experience while filming the show. When the show's host Kapil Sharma questioned them about wearing heavy lehengas, the actors said that the costumes were even heavier than their actual weight.
Recalling a hilarious incident while performing the mujra, Aditi Rao Hydari said, “When I was doing the mujra scene, there was a fountain filled with water. When I twirled while dancing, I nearly lost my balance. So Sanjay air said, ‘Choti hai isko peeche karo. She will fall.” When asked about the weight of her lehenga, Aditi said, “I think it weighed more than me.”
Talking about the costumes, Manisha Koirala said, “Definitely it was very heavy but we enjoyed it. Everything is picked by Sanjay and approved by him and then we carried it all. Some days, the hair pieces were quite heavy too.”

Earlier, the star cast reunited for a Mushaira Roast with comedian Munawar Faruqui. Netflix India shared a video of the session on YouTube. The teams in question were ""Sonakshi Ki Saheliyan"" and ""Manisha Ki Mallikain."" Aditi Rao Hydari was a part of Manisha Koirala's team. Greeting the actress, who stars as Bibbojaan in the series, Munawar said, ""Hi Aditi. She is quite a moralistic and principled personality. Right? Do you agree?"" Everyone in the room agreed with Munawar. He added, ""Mai bhi yahi kehna chahta hoon, ye apne Siddharthon se dur nahi rehtin (Even I am trying to say the same thing, she can't stay away from her principles)."" Aditi Rao Hydari started blushing and she did the grace face pose (IYKYK) and said, ""Bilkul nahi, kabhi nahi (Absolutely not, never).""

Manisha Koirala, soaring high with the success of Heeramandi, shared a long post about how the series turned out to be a ""milestone"" in her life professionally and personally. Manisha pointed out that she had never imagined life would give her a second opportunity after ""turning 50"" and battling with cancer. Manisha shared some beautiful snapshots from the series and wrote, ""I could never have imagined that after cancer and turning 50, my life would flower into this other phase. Two reasons: 1. Heeramandi has been a significant milestone. As a 53-year-old actor who has bagged an important role in a high-profile web series, I am overjoyed that I'm not stuck playing insignificant peripheral roles, thanks to OTT platforms and changing audience profiles. Finally, female actors, technicians, and other professionals have started getting the long overdue and well-deserved good quality of work and respect in a professional environment. I am fortunate to be a part of this evolving era.""
Manisha wrote about the second reason, ""2. Today, when I am receiving so many accolades, I can't help but remember the doubts and anxiety that plagued me when I was about to start shooting. Still recovering from the dreaded C, would my body be strong enough to deal with the intense shooting schedules, heavy costumes, and jewelry, and perform a role requiring so much nuance and effortless effort?""
Manisha also recalled the experience of shooting the ""most physically challenging"" fountain sequence. FYI, Manisha was raped by the British officers as a price she paid to release her daughter Alamzeb from the clutches of the officers. After the gruelling torture, Manisha sat under a fountain to relieve her pain (physical and psychological). About the shooting experience, Manisha wrote, ""The fountain sequence proved the most physically challenging. It required me to be immersed in a water fountain for over 12 hours. That tested my resilience! Even though Sanjay had thoughtfully ensured that the water was warm and clean, over the hours, the water turned muddy, (because my team members, the Cinematographer, and the art director's team were getting into the water to work around the scene.) Every single pore in my body was soaked in that muddy water. Even though I was beyond exhaustion by the end of the shoot, I felt a deep happiness within my heart. My body had taken the stress and remained resilient. I knew I had passed a critical physical test.""

Manisha signed off her long post with these words, ""To you, who think your time has come and gone, whether it's due to age, illness or any setback, never give up! You never know what could be waiting for you around the bend!""

During the promotions of Heeramandi, Manisha Koirala talked about her journey in the film industry, life after battling cancer and her experience of working with Sanjay Leela Bhansali after 28 years. During her interaction with NDTV, Manisha said, ""When I was offered this project, I was in Nepal, gardening and I was really thrilled. I waited for such a long time. It took 28 years of waiting and finally Sanjay came with a good project and i told him, 'Sanjay don't take another 28 years to offer me another good one.'""

She continued, ""I have seen his movies after Khamoshi. So much pleasure and joy it gives me to see his career graph and one after the other brilliant film he has made. At this age and stage in my life when I was offered this, I was really thrilled.""
Heeramandi opened to largely positive reviews. In his review for NDTV, film critic Saibal Chatterjee wrote, ""Bhansali tempers his maximalist methods with restraint. The series is a celebration of as well as a lament for a house of spirited courtesans yearning for dignity and liberty in the tumultuous final years of the British Raj, an era marked by the rapidly declining clout of the nawabs who were the chief patrons of the nautch girls of Heeramandi.""

In the video, Harsh can be seen asking Orry if he charges money for appearances. To this, Bharti adds, “Mehenge ho? [Are you expensive?]” In his signature rustic Hindi, Orry replies, “Haan. Kya mai sasta dikhta hai kya? [Yes. Do I look cheap to you?].” When Bharti asks Orry if he charges as much as  ₹ 20 lakh for a photo, Orry says, “Ji, kya mai aapko photo dega to mai diya hai.

(Image courtesy: itsfilmyverse)
Actor Indresh Malik, who played the role of Ustaad ji on the Netflix series Heeramandi: The Diamond Bazaar, said that he “howled” after he performed the nath sequence on the show, which led to filmmaker Sanjay Leela Bhansali rewarding him with Rs 500 as a token of appreciation for his moving performance. For the unversed, Indresh played the role of a queer man in the series. The actor, in an interview with Times Now, said that when Sanjay Leela Bhansali narrated the scene to him, he had “tears” in his eyes even though the scene itself had no dialogue.
He said, “The scene for my character felt like, there was someone who accepted me, the one who gave me warmth. Wearing nath means gaining respect. That moment when the scene was done, I was crying for almost five minutes or more. I can't cry silently, so I howled. I was howling and crying like a child, there was a pin-drop silence.”
The actor added, “He said, ‘Dekho, rota jaa raha hai, itna achaa toh kiya (Why are you crying, you did so well)'. Then he hugged me and gave me Rs 500 on the sets as a token of appreciation. I kept thinking about the character and that carried on for five minutes.""

Recently, Jason Shah, who portrays the role of British police officer Cartwright, opened up about the same-sex scene in the series with Ustadji played by Indresh Malik. In an interview with Filmibeat OTT, Jason Shah admitted that initially he was hesitant to shoot the scene but he had full confidence that the director would not portray it cheaply.
“To be so close to another man, you will face… hesitation is the perfect word. I wasn't hesitating to say yes to the show, and I felt comfortable because I was working with Sanjay Leela Bhansali, so I knew aesthetically, it wouldn't be portrayed in a way that would seem cheap. I knew that his standard would be met. I was definitely nervous coming up to that day. They told me in the night that tomorrow would be that scene,” he said.
He also praised his co-star Indresh Malik and thanked him for ensuring that he was comfortable before their intimate scene.
